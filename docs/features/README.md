# Feature Specifications

All user-facing features must have a feature spec before implementation.

## How to Add a Feature Spec
1. Copy `FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md` to a new file.
2. Name the file with a sortable prefix and short slug.
3. Link relevant ADRs and backend contract assumptions.
4. Mark unknowns clearly so reviewers can resolve them early.

## Naming Convention
- Format: `NNNN-feature-name.md`
- Example: `0001-server-join-flow.md`

## Planned MVP Specs (To Be Authored)
- Authentication session UI.
- Server join and registry management.
- Channel list and navigation.
- Message timeline and composer.
- Presence and typing indicators.
- Notifications.
- Settings and accessibility foundations.
